                <h3>My Education</h3>
                <p>I have a bachelors degree in Art History, I have an associates degree in Computer Science, some formal training in Web Design and I was only recently introduced to LEGO in 2018.</p>

                <h3>A little About me</h3>
                <p>I’ve always been intested in the design of spaces around me from car interiors to museum displays. When I was studing art history I focused on how the art was displayed and how the space affects the way the art is experienced. Other topics I was really drawn to were digital archiving/conservation and how we can use those tools to study and reconstruct how art and artifacts would have been experienced in the past.
                A few years ago I was introduced to UX. I hadn’t heard it before and I didn’t entirely understand what it was but it sounded like it was an extention of my passion, just in a different field.
                I like thinking about spaces and how they’re designed. I’m always looking to expand my knowledge on the topic becuase I want to be able to design better spaces in the real world, on the web, and in my LEGO creations.</p>
