            </div>

            <div class="musing-child m-2">    
                <p>Shortly after the pandemic started I bought a mug off of Etsy. It’s handmade, cermaic, with several glazes overlaping  eaching other. The colors range from a robin’s egg blue to vermillion to a dark violet, and it’s very glossy.</p>

                <img src="images/mug-2.jpg" alt="">
            </div>

            <div class="musing-child m-4">
                <p>I used this mug for nearly eight months before I realized the handle, which is arguably the second most important feature of a mug (if only because there are really well insulated mugs), was causing a really uncomfortable calluse on the upper inside knuckle of my index finger. The handle grip is wide and flat, and comes out far enough that I can easily wrap all four fingers around it, but I rarely hold the mug this way. Unfortunately, the way I was holding the mug was by the handle with three fingers (index, middle, ring) through the handle and my pinky tucked in my palm. This lead to the weight of the mug and its contents being put on my index, which left the calluse.</p>

            <div class="musing-child m-5">
                <img src="images/mug-1.jpg" alt="">
            </div>

            <div class="musing-child m-6">
                <p>The funny thing is I still use this mug nearly eaveryday, despite its flaws. I’ve simply changed how I use it. This mug is unique, it has an uncomfortable handle that can never be adjusted, but I’m a sucker for pretty things.</p>
